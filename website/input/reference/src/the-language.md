# The Language

This section begins with three in-depth chapters describing...
- The [parser](syntax-and-types.md), which converts GameLisp source text into data.
- The [expander](macros.md), which takes GameLisp data and performs transformations on it.
- The [evaluator](evaluation.md), which takes expanded GameLisp data and executes it as a program.

The rest of this section then takes a more casual tour through the GameLisp Standard Library, 
introducing the most important built-in functions, macros and special forms.

After finishing this section, you should feel confident writing basic GameLisp code, referring 
back to the first three chapters and the [standard library documentaton](../std/) when necessary.

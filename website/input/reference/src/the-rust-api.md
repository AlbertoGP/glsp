# The Rust API

This section will take you on a guided tour of the `glsp` crate: the Rust API which can be used
to create and manipulate a GameLisp runtime.

Binding script code to native code tends to be a pain point when using languages like Lua
and Python. GameLisp leverages Rust's powerful type system and macro system to make its interface 
with Rust as seamless as possible.
